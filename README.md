# online-shopping-app
This project is an Online Shopping Application developed using Python (Tkinter) for the frontend and MySQL (SQL) for the backend database. The application allows users to browse products, search items, add products to a shopping cart, and place orders through a graphical user interface. All product and order information is stored and managed using a relational database, demonstrating core DBMS concepts and database connectivity.

The application provides features such as product listing with search functionality, adding products to a shopping cart, updating and removing items from the cart, automatic total price calculation, checkout and order storage in the database, MySQL database integration, and a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.

The technologies used in this project include Python with Tkinter for the frontend, MySQL for the backend database, SQL for database operations, and the mysql-connector-python library for database connectivity.

To run the project, install Python 3.x and MySQL Server with MySQL Workbench. Create the database by executing the online_shopping.sql file. Install the required Python package using pip install mysql-connector-python. Update the MySQL credentials in the Python file and run the application using python frontend/app.py.
